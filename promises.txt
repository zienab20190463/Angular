promise is one of this states :
1)pending=> rejected
2)fulfilled=>operation succeeded

code:

const mypromise=new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{


let connect=true;

if(connect){
    resolve("connection done")
}else{
    reject(Error("connection failed"))
}

});
mypromise.then(
    (resolved)=>console.log(resolved), //btgeeb el content bta3 resolve
    (rejected)=>console.log(rejected) //lw fe error 
)
